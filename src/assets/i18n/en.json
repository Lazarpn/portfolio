    "idealWeddingExperienceDescription": "I had the privilege of contributing to the development of a wedding planning web application startup, where I was mentored by an experienced senior developer. This opportunity allowed me to learn invaluable best practices and gain deep insights into building robust, scalable applications. The project was built using Angular for the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend, with an MSSQL database at its core. One of the highlights was implementing real-time communication through SignalR, where I developed a web chat feature to enhance user engagement. Additionally, I had the chance to deploy the project on Azure, leveraging Azure Table Storage for managing media assets like images and videos. Throughout this project, I also worked with a variety of powerful libraries, including Leaflet for mapping, LightGallery for image galleries, and Swiper for sleek, responsive carousels, all contributing to an intuitive and dynamic user experience.",
